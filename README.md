# Numerical-Methods
Numerical Method Routines Implememted Out of Chapra &amp; Canale's Excellent Book: Applied Numerical Methods With MATLAB with some of my Personal Improvisations.

# Objectives of the Project:

1. Provide Efficient Root Finding, Optimzation, Calculus, Ordinary Differential Equation, Partial Differential Equation and Linear Algebra Routines adapted from Chapra and Canale's Book Implemented in Python.
2. Specialize these techniques to appropriate Mechanical Engineering Problems.
3. Ensure maximum simplicity of codes and reproducibilty.
4. Implement routines using NumPy whenever possible.
